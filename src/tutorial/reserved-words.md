# Reserved Words

The following list of words are reserved words in the Blade programming language and cannot be used 
as an identifier anywhere in your code whether as variable, class, function or method name. This 
reserved words (also refered to as Keywords in the rest of the documentation) must be written exactly 
as shown here. 

**`and`** , **`as`** , **`assert`** , **`break`** , **`catch`** , **`class`** , 
**`continue`** , **`def`** , **`default`** , **`die`** , **`do`** , **`echo`** ,
**`else`** , **`false`** , **`finally`** , **`for`** , **`if`** , **`import`** ,
**`in`** , **`iter`** , **`nil`** , **`or`** , **`parent`** , **`return`** ,
**`self`** , **`static`** , **`true`** , **`try`** , **`using`** , **`var`** ,
**`when`** , **`while`**.

> Reserved words are case-sensitive. While `and` is a reserved word, `And` is simply a variable 
> (You'll learn about them soon enough).
