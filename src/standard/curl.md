## Functions

#### get\_time(date_string)

Returns the number of seconds since the Epoch, January 1st 1970 00:00:00 in 
the UTC time zone, for the date and time that the date_string parameter specifies.

**PARSING DATES AND TIMES**

A "date" is a string containing several items separated by whitespace.
The order of the items is immaterial.  A date string may contain many
flavors of items:

- **Calendar date**
   Can be specified several ways. Month names can only be three-letter english 
   abbreviations, numbers can be zero-prefixed and the year may use 2 or 4 digits.  
   
   Examples: 06 Nov 1994, 06-Nov-94 and Nov-94 6.

- **Time of the day**
   This string specifies the time on a given day. You must specify it with 6 digits 
   with two colons: HH:MM:SS. To not include the time in a date string, will make the 
   function assume 00:00:00.

   Example: 18:19:21.

- **Time zone**
   Specifies international time zone. There are a few acronyms supported, but in 
   general you should instead use the specific relative time compared to UTC. 
   Supported formats include: -1200, MST, +0100.

- **Day of the week items**
   Specifies a day of the week. Days of the week may be spelled out in full (using 
   english): Sunday, Monday, etc or they may be abbreviated to their first three 
   letters. This is usually not info that adds anything.

- **Pure numbers**
   If a decimal number of the form YYYYMMDD appears, then YYYY is read as the year, 
   MM as the month number and DD as the day of the month, for the specified calendar 
   date.

**STANDARDS**

This parser was written to handle date formats specified in RFC 822 (including the 
update in RFC 1123) using time zone name or time zone delta and RFC 850 (obsoleted 
by RFC 1036) and ANSI C's asctime() format. These formats are the only ones RFC 7231 
says HTTP applications may use.

## Classes

### _class_ Info

cURL request and response informations for `get_info()`

#### Fields

- **EFFECTIVE\_URL** &#8674; _static_:

  Gets the last used effective URL. If follow redirects is enabled, 
it may very well not be the same value you set in the original request.

- **RESPONSE\_CODE** &#8674; _static_:

  The last received HTTP, FTP or SMTP response code. The value will be 
zero if no server response code has been received.

- **TOTAL\_TIME** &#8674; _static_:

  The total time in seconds for the previous transfer, including name resolving, 
TCP connect etc. The value represents the time in seconds, including fractions.

- **NAMELOOKUP\_TIME** &#8674; _static_:

  The total time in seconds from the start until the name resolving was completed.

- **CONNECT\_TIME** &#8674; _static_:

  The total time in seconds from the start until the connection to the remote host 
(or proxy) was completed.

- **PRETRANSFER\_TIME** &#8674; _static_:

  The time, in seconds, it took from the start until a file transfer is just about 
to begin.

This time-stamp includes all pre-transfer commands and negotiations that are 
specific to the particular protocol(s) involved. It includes the sending of the 
protocol- specific protocol instructions that triggers a transfer.

- **SIZE\_UPLOAD** &#8674; _static_:

  The total amount of bytes that were uploaded.

- **SIZE\_DOWNLOAD** &#8674; _static_:

  The total amount of bytes that were  downloaded.  The amount is only for the 
latest transfer and will be reset again for each new transfer. This counts actual 
payload data, what's also commonly called body. All meta and header data are 
excluded and will not be counted in this number.

- **SPEED\_DOWNLOAD** &#8674; _static_:

  The average download speed that curl measured for the complete download. Measured 
in bytes/second.

- **SPEED\_UPLOAD** &#8674; _static_:

  The average upload speed that curl measured for the complete upload. Measured 
in bytes/second.

- **HEADER\_SIZE** &#8674; _static_:

  The total size of all the headers received. Measured in number of bytes.

- **REQUEST\_SIZE** &#8674; _static_:

  The total size of the issued requests. This is so far only for HTTP requests.

- **SSL\_VERIFYRESULT** &#8674; _static_:

  The result of the server SSL certificate verification that was requested (using 
the `Options.SSL_VERIFYPEER` option).

- **FILETIME** &#8674; _static_:

  The remote time of the retrieved document (in number of seconds since 1 jan 1970 
in the GMT/UTC time zone). If you get -1, it can be because of many reasons (it might 
be unknown, the server might hide it or the server doesn't support the command that 
tells document time etc) and the time of the document is unknown.

You _MUST_ to collect this information before the transfer is made, by using the 
`Options.FILETIME` option to `set_option()` or you will unconditionally get a -1 back.

- **CONTENT\_LENGTH\_DOWNLOAD** &#8674; _static_:

  The content-length of the download. This is the value read from the `Content-Length:` 
field. It is -1 if the size isn't known.

- **CONTENT\_LENGTH\_UPLOAD** &#8674; _static_:

  The content-length of the upload. It is -1 if the size isn't known.

- **STARTTRANSFER\_TIME** &#8674; _static_:

  The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the first byte is received by 
`curl`. This includes `PRETRANSFER_TIME` and also the time the server needs to 
calculate the result.

- **CONTENT\_TYPE** &#8674; _static_:

  The content-type of the downloaded object. This is the value read from the 
`Content-Type:` field. If you get `nil`, it means that the server didn't send a 
valid Content-Type header or that the protocol used doesn't support this.

- **REDIRECT\_TIME** &#8674; _static_:

  The total time, in seconds, it took for all redirection steps include name lookup, 
connect, pretransfer and transfer before final transaction was started.

- **REDIRECT\_COUNT** &#8674; _static_:

  The total number of redirections that were actually followed.

- **HTTP\_CONNECTCODE** &#8674; _static_:

  The last received HTTP proxy response code to a CONNECT request. The returned value 
will be zero if no such response code was available.

- **HTTPAUTH\_AVAIL** &#8674; _static_:

  A bitmask indicating the authentication method(s) available according to the 
previous response.

- **PROXYAUTH\_AVAIL** &#8674; _static_:

  A bitmask indicating the authentication method(s) available according to the 
previous response.

- **OS\_ERRNO** &#8674; _static_:

  The errno variable from a connect failure.  Note that the value is only set on 
failure, it is not reset upon a successful operation. The number is OS and system 
specific.

- **NUM\_CONNECTS** &#8674; _static_:

  How many new connections `curl` had to create to achieve the previous transfer 
(only the successful connects are counted). Combined with `REDIRECT_COUNT` you are 
able to know how many times `curl` successfully reused existing connection(s) or not.

- **COOKIELIST** &#8674; _static_:

  A list of all cookies curl knows (expired ones, too). If there are no cookies, an 
empty list is returned.


> Cookies that were imported in the Set-Cookie format without a domain name may not 
> exported by this option.

- **FTP\_ENTRY\_PATH** &#8674; _static_:

  A string holding the path of the entry path. That is the initial path `curl` ended up 
in when logging on to the remote FTP server. This value is `nil` if something is wrong.

- **REDIRECT\_URL** &#8674; _static_:

  The URL a redirect would take you to if you would enable `FOLLOWLOCATION`. This can 
come very handy if you think using the built-in `curl` redirect logic isn't good
enough for you but you would still prefer to avoid implementing all the magic of 
figuring out the new URL.

- **PRIMARY\_IP** &#8674; _static_:

  A string holding the IP address of the most recent connection done with this `curl` 
handle.

- **APPCONNECT\_TIME** &#8674; _static_:

  The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the SSL/SSH connect/handshake to 
the remote host was completed.  This time is most often very near to the 
`PRETRANSFER_TIME` time, except for cases such as HTTP pipelining where the pretransfer
time can be delayed due to waits in line for the pipeline and more.

- **CERTINFO** &#8674; _static_:

  Lists with info about the certificate chain, assuming you had `Options.CERTINFO` 
enabled when the request was made. Information in each entry of the list is provided 
in a series of data in the format "name:content" where the content is for the specific 
named data.

- **CONDITION\_UNMET** &#8674; _static_:

  The number `1` if the condition provided in the previous request didn't match 
(see `Options.TIMECONDITION`). Alas, if this returns a `1` you know that the 
reason you didn't get data in return is because it didn't fulfill the condition. 
This value will be zero if the condition was met. This can also return `1` if the 
server responded with a 304 HTTP status code, for example after sending a custom 
"If-Match-" header.
 @static

protocol- specific request that triggers a transfer.

- **STARTTRANSFER\_TIME\_T** &#8674; _static_:

  The total time in microseconds from the start until the first byte is received by 
`curl`. This includes `PRETRANSFER_TIME_T` and also the time the server needs to 
calculate the result.

pretransfer time can be delayed due to waits in line for the pipeline and more.

- **RETRY\_AFTER** &#8674; _static_:

  The number of seconds the HTTP server suggests the client should wait until the 
next request is issued.

### _class_ Curl

cURL class

#### Methods

#### Curl() &#8674; Constructor




#### set\_option(option, value)

This function is used to tell `curl` how to behave. By setting the
appropriate options, the application can change `curl`'s behavior.  
All options are set with an option followed by a parameter. That parameter
can be a number, boolean, string, or an object pointer, depending on what 
the specific option expects. Read this `cURL` manual carefully as bad input 
values may cause `curl` to behave badly!  You can only set one option in each 
function call. A typical application uses many `set_option()` calls in the 
setup phase.

Options set with this function call are valid for all forthcoming
transfers performed using this instance.  The options are not in any way
reset between transfers, so if you want subsequent transfers with
different options, you must change them between the transfers. You can
optionally reset all options back to internal default with `reset()`.

##### Parameters

- _Option_ **option**
- _any_ **value**

##### Returns

- boolean
##### Notes

- Strings passed to `curl` as arguments, must not exceed 8MB in size.
- The order in which the options are set does not matter.

#### get\_info(info)

Requests internal information from the `curl` session with this function.
Use this function AFTER performing a transfer if you want to get transfer 
related data.

##### Parameters

- _Info_ **info**

##### Returns

- string|number|list

#### escape(str)

This function converts the given input string to a URL encoded string and
returns that as a new allocated string. All input characters that are not
a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '-', '.', '_' or '~' are converted to their "URL escaped"
version (%NN where NN is a two-digit hexadecimal number).

##### Parameters

- _string_ **str**

##### Returns

- string
##### Notes

- This function does not accept a strings longer than 8MB.

#### unescape(str)

This function converts the given URL encoded input string to a "plain
string" and returns that in an allocated memory area. All input characters 
that are URL encoded (%XX where XX is a two-digit hexadecimal number) are 
converted to their decoded versions.

##### Parameters

- _string_ **str**

##### Returns

- string

#### send()

Performs the entire request in a blocking manner and returns when done, or 
if it failed. It returns a dictionary containing the `headers` and `body` key.


> You must never call this function simultaneously from two places using
> the same instance. Let the function return first before invoking it
> another time.

##### Returns

- dict

#### reset()

Re-initializes the instace to the default values. This puts back the
instance to the same state as it was in when it was just created.

> It keeps live connections, the Session ID cache, the DNS cache, the
> cookies , the shares or the alt-svc cache.


#### close()

Closes the current Curl instance.

This might close all connections this instance has used and possibly has
kept open until now - unless it was attached to a multi handle while
doing the transfers. Don't call this function if you intend to transfer
more files, re-using Curl instances is a key to good performance.

##### Notes

- Calling a function on the instance after this function has been called is illegal

#### get\_pointer()

Returns the raw pointer object to the underlying libcurl.
